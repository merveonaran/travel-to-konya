This app is only designed to promote a city. The names of the places to visit are displayed on the first screen using animation. 
Pressing any of the buttons displays brief information and photos about that place. It also allows it to navigate to the location using Google maps.
Menu items are used in the application. Language settings can be changed from here to Turkish and English. At the same time, the most famous dishes
can be accessed from the menu item. When pressed, the names of the dishes are brought up using the list view and at the same time, the ability to 
click on the list view is given. A photo of each dish is displayed. Array adapters are used for this.
